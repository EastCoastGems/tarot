      meaning_upright: "You've been feeling that restless energy lately, haven't you? That sense that you're meant for something more than your current situation. This card says it's time to trust that feeling. Yes, it's scary to leave what's familiar, but staying where you are just because it's safe is actually riskier than taking the leap. You have everything you need already‚Äîyour experiences, your talents, even your mistakes have prepared you for this moment. That opportunity you've been considering? That conversation you've been avoiding? That dream you keep pushing aside? Now is the time. Stop waiting for perfect conditions or more confidence. Your courage will grow as you move forward, not before.",
      meaning_reversed: "You know there's something you need to do, but you keep finding reasons to put it off. Maybe you're telling yourself you need more experience, more money, or more time. But if you're honest, it's really about fear‚Äîfear of failure, fear of judgment, fear of the unknown. Here's the thing: that fear is actually a compass pointing toward what matters most to you. Instead of fighting it, acknowledge it and move forward anyway. What's the worst that could realistically happen? And what's the cost of staying exactly where you are for another year? You're stronger than you think, and you deserve to find out what you're truly capable of."

      meaning_upright: "Everything is aligning for you right now. That project you've been working on? The skills you've been developing? The network you've been building? It's all coming together. You have the resources, the knowledge, and the support you need to make this happen. Stop second-guessing yourself or waiting for someone else to give you permission. You are the permission. Your ideas are valid, your vision is achievable, and your timing is better than you think. Take that meeting, send that email, make that investment. When you act with clear intention and focused energy, the universe responds. Trust your instincts‚Äîthey're sharper than usual right now.",
      meaning_reversed: "You have the skills and resources, but something's off with how you're using them. Maybe you're trying to control too much of the outcome, or maybe you're scattered across too many projects. Or perhaps you're using your talents to impress others rather than pursuing what genuinely matters to you. Take a step back and check your motivations. Are you trying to force something that isn't meant to be? Are you overthinking instead of trusting the process? Sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is simplify your approach and focus on one clear goal at a time."
    },
    {
      name: "The High Priestess",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/YTd7wZqM/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "You already know the answer to that question you've been asking everyone else about. Deep down, beneath all the noise and opinions, you know exactly what you need to do. The challenge is trusting that knowing, especially when it goes against what seems logical or what others expect. Pay attention to what makes you feel expansive versus what makes you contract. Notice the subtle signs‚Äîthe dreams that keep recurring, the conversations that feel synchronistic, the gut feelings that arise when you're considering different options. Your intuition is your superpower right now. Stop seeking external validation and start honoring the wisdom that's already within you.",
      meaning_reversed: "You've been asking everyone else what they think you should do, but you're getting more confused instead of clearer. Or maybe you've been so busy that you haven't given yourself the quiet space needed to hear your own inner voice. Sometimes we outsource our decision-making because we don't want to take responsibility for the outcome. But here's the truth: no one else can live your life for you. Take some time alone‚Äîreally alone‚Äîand ask yourself what you actually want, not what you think you should want. The answer might surprise you, and it might be simpler than you think."
    },

      meaning_upright: "You're in a season of abundance and growth, but you need to actually receive it. You're so good at taking care of everyone else that you sometimes forget to nurture yourself. This card is reminding you that your own well-being isn't selfish‚Äîit's necessary. That creative project you've been putting off? Make time for it. That self-care routine you keep skipping? Prioritize it. The people in your life who truly matter will support your growth, not guilt you for taking care of yourself. You have a gift for bringing beauty and comfort into the world, but you can't give what you don't have. Fill your own cup first.",
      meaning_reversed: "You've been giving so much of yourself that you're running on empty. You might not even realize how depleted you are because you're so used to pushing through. But your body knows, your energy knows, and probably the people closest to you have noticed too. It's time to pull back and replenish. This doesn't mean you stop caring for others‚Äîit means you care for yourself with the same intensity. What would you tell a friend who was in your situation? Give yourself that same compassion and practical advice."

      meaning_upright: "It's time to get organized and take control of your situation. You've been thinking and planning long enough‚Äînow you need structure and action. Whether it's your finances, your career, your health, or your living situation, you have the capability to create the stability you need. Stop waiting for someone else to fix things or for conditions to be perfect. Set clear goals, make realistic plans, and follow through consistently. You're more capable of leadership than you give yourself credit for. People are looking to you for direction, even if they haven't said so directly. Step up and create the framework that will support your long-term success.",
      meaning_reversed: "Either you're being too controlling and rigid, or you're avoiding taking charge when you really need to. If it's the former, you might be micromanaging others or trying to force outcomes through sheer willpower. If it's the latter, you might be procrastinating on important decisions or letting others make choices that are really yours to make. Both approaches will keep you stuck. Find the middle ground: be decisive about what's yours to control, and let go of what isn't. Sometimes being a leader means knowing when to step back."

      meaning_upright: "Someone in your life has wisdom you need right now‚Äîa mentor, teacher, or even that friend who always gives solid advice. You don't have to figure everything out alone. There's value in learning from those who've walked this path before you. Maybe it's time to take that class, join that group, or ask for guidance from someone you respect. Traditional approaches might actually work better than trying to reinvent the wheel. Sometimes the old ways are old because they work.",
      meaning_reversed: "You're questioning the rules and expectations that others have placed on you, and that's exactly what you should be doing. Just because 'that's how it's always been done' doesn't mean it's right for you. Trust your own moral compass, even if it leads you away from what your family, community, or society expects. Your path doesn't have to look like anyone else's to be valid. Sometimes breaking from tradition is the most spiritual thing you can do."

      meaning_upright: "This isn't just about romantic love‚Äîthough it might be. You're facing a choice between two paths, two people, or two versions of yourself. The key is alignment: what choice honors who you really are at your core? You know that relationship or situation that makes you feel most like yourself? That's your answer. Don't choose based on what looks good on paper or what others expect. Choose what makes your soul feel at home.

Maybe you've talked to someone, started therapy, found medication that helps, or just reached a point where you're too exhausted to keep torturing yourself with worry. The worst of the anxiety storm is passing, and you're learning to cope with your thoughts instead of being completely overwhelmed by them. This doesn't mean everything's perfect, but you're developing better tools for handling your mental health."

You feel like you've been stabbed in the back (maybe literally metaphorically) and left for dead. The good news? When you're at absolute rock bottom, the only direction to go is up. This ending, as brutal as it is, is clearing the way for something completely new to begin. You can't rebuild on a shaky foundation anyway.",

You're not all the way healed yet, but you're starting to extract the lessons from this disaster and use them to build something better.
