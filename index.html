      name: "The Fool",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/67C86gFm/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "You're standing at the edge of something new. A leap that feels risky, but thrilling. Trust that the universe will catch you. This is your reminder that even if the path is unknown, your spirit is ready.",
      meaning_reversed: "You're hesitating. Stuck between wanting more and fearing what might go wrong. Fear is natural, but don't let it keep you from your next chapter. You were made for more."
    },
    {
      name: "The Magician",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/hQWb5wn/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "You already have everything you need. This is your green light. Manifest, create, take action. Your potential is unmatched when you believe in your own magic.",
      meaning_reversed: "You might be doubting yourself or misusing your energy. Are you aligned with your truth? It's time to reconnect with your inner power and use it with intention."
    },
    {
      name: "The High Priestess",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/YTd7wZqM/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "You've been sensing things lately that you can't quite explain, haven't you? That feeling when someone texts you right as you're thinking about them, or when you walk into a room and just know something's off. This card is telling you to pay attention to those moments. Your intuition is speaking louder than it ever has, but you keep second-guessing it. Stop analyzing every gut feeling to death. That quiet voice inside you? It's been right more often than you want to admit. The answer you're looking for isn't going to come from Google or asking ten different peopleâit's already sitting in that space between your thoughts. Trust what you know without knowing how you know it.",
      meaning_reversed: "You're drowning out your inner voice with everyone else's opinions, aren't you? Maybe you've been asking for advice when deep down you already know what you need to do. Or perhaps you're so caught up in being logical and practical that you've forgotten how to feel your way through decisions. Your intuition hasn't disappearedâyou've just been too busy or too scared to listen. It's time to get quiet. Turn off the noise, step away from the advice-givers, and reconnect with that wise part of yourself that's been patiently waiting for you to remember it exists."
    },
    {
      name: "The Empress",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/nv8RHrN/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "You're in a beautiful creative phase right now, even if it doesn't feel that way. Maybe you're nurturing a new project, a relationship, or even a new version of yourself. This card reminds you that creation takes time and tenderness. Stop rushing the process or comparing your beginning to someone else's middle. Whether you're literally growing something, building something, or healing something, your loving attention is the secret ingredient. You have this incredible ability to help things flourishâbut that includes yourself too. When was the last time you gave yourself the same patient, unconditional care you give to others?",
      meaning_reversed: "You're running on empty, aren't you? Giving and giving until you have nothing left. Maybe you've been so focused on taking care of everyone else that you've forgotten to water your own garden. Or perhaps you're being too hard on yourself about your creative output, expecting perfection instead of enjoying the process. This is your reminder that you can't pour from an empty cup. It's not selfish to rest, to say no, or to put your own needs first sometimes. In fact, it's necessary. You'll be so much more effective at loving others when you remember how to love yourself first."
    },
    {
      name: "The Emperor",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/8g7ZwLB5/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "It's time to step into your authority and stop apologizing for taking up space. You have more power than you're using right nowâmaybe you're afraid of being seen as bossy or difficult, but there's a difference between being controlling and being in control. This card is asking you to set clear boundaries, make the tough decisions, and trust your ability to lead. That situation you've been hoping someone else will handle? It's yours to manage. That goal you've been tiptoeing around? It's time to make a real plan and execute it. You're stronger and more capable than you give yourself credit for.",
      meaning_reversed: "You're either being too rigid or too passive right now, and both are blocking your progress. Maybe you're trying to control every detail and it's exhausting everyone around you, including yourself. Or maybe you're avoiding responsibility and waiting for someone else to take charge. Neither approach is working. Real strength comes from knowing when to hold firm and when to bend. Ask yourself: are you being inflexible because you're afraid of losing control, or are you avoiding leadership because you're afraid of making the wrong choice? Either way, it's time to find your middle ground."
    },
    {
      name: "The Hierophant",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/GvdKW1c6/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "You're being guided right now, even if it doesn't feel obvious. Maybe it's through a mentor who keeps showing up in your life, a book that fell into your lap at the perfect moment, or even your own growing understanding of what you believe in. This card suggests that the answers you need are available, but you might need to look in traditional places or seek wisdom from those who've walked this path before. Don't be too proud to learn from others, and don't dismiss advice just because it comes wrapped in conventional wisdom. Sometimes the old ways work because they've been tested by time.",
      meaning_reversed: "You're outgrowing the rules and structures that once made sense for you, and that's exactly what's supposed to be happening. Maybe the advice that everyone keeps giving you feels wrong in your gut, or the path that worked for others doesn't fit your life. This isn't rebellion for rebellion's sakeâit's evolution. Trust that your journey is allowed to look different. You're not being difficult or ungrateful when you choose your own way; you're being authentic. The people who truly care about you will support your growth, even when they don't understand it."
    },
    {
      name: "The Lovers",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/3Pn6vJn/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "This isn't just about romantic loveâthough it could be. This is about alignment, about finding harmony between different parts of yourself or your life. You're facing a choice that matters, and your heart knows the right answer even if your head is making it complicated. Maybe you're trying to decide between what looks good on paper and what feels right in your soul. Trust what brings you joy and makes you feel more like yourself. The right choice will feel like coming home to yourself, even if it's scary or unconventional.",
      meaning_reversed: "You're out of sync with yourself right now, and it's showing up in your relationships or major decisions. Maybe you're trying to force something that isn't meant to be, or you're avoiding a choice because you're afraid of disappointing someone. This disconnection between what you want and what you think you should want is exhausting, isn't it? It's time to get honest about what you actually value, not what you think you should value. The people who belong in your life will love you for who you are, not who you pretend to be."
    },
    {
      name: "The Chariot",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/whYR0Mxd/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "You're in the driver's seat now, and it's time to act like it. That goal you've been working toward? You have everything you need to make it happen, but you need to focus your energy and actually move forward. Stop second-guessing yourself or waiting for perfect conditions. You've done the preparation, you've gathered the resourcesânow it's time to trust yourself and go. Your determination is your superpower right now, but remember that real strength comes from knowing where you're headed, not just how fast you can get there.",
      meaning_reversed: "You're spinning your wheels, aren't you? Maybe you're trying to control too many things at once, or you've lost sight of what you actually want to achieve. It feels like you're working hard but not getting anywhere, and that's because you're scattered. Take a step back and ask yourself: what's really important here? Sometimes you need to slow down to speed up. Get clear on your priorities, make a plan, and then commit to it. You can't steer effectively if you don't know where you're going."
    },
    {
      name: "Strength",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/bgKMCrVW/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "The strength you need isn't the kind that comes from gritting your teeth and pushing through. It's the quiet kind that comes from self-compassion and patience. You're dealing with something challenging right now, and your instinct might be to fight it or force a solution. But what if you approached it with gentleness instead? You're stronger than you know, but real strength often looks like kindnessâespecially kindness toward yourself. That inner critic that's been so loud lately? It's time to have a gentle but firm conversation with it.",
      meaning_reversed: "You're being too hard on yourself, and it's actually making you weaker, not stronger. Maybe you're pushing yourself past your limits or beating yourself up for not being perfect. That harsh inner voice isn't motivating youâit's depleting you. True strength requires you to be on your own team. What would change if you talked to yourself the way you talk to someone you love? It's time to find the balance between discipline and self-compassion. You don't have to earn your worth through suffering."
    },
    {
      name: "The Hermit",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/7dtckmDm/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "You need some space to think, and that's not a luxuryâit's a necessity. All the noise and opinions and expectations swirling around you are making it impossible to hear your own thoughts. This card is giving you permission to step back, turn down the volume on everyone else's voice, and reconnect with what you actually think and feel. The answer you're looking for isn't going to come from another person or another articleâit's going to come from getting quiet enough to hear your own wisdom. Don't feel guilty about needing solitude; it's how you recharge your spiritual batteries.",
      meaning_reversed: "You've been hiding, haven't you? Maybe you're calling it self-care or introspection, but if you're honest, you're avoiding something that needs your attention. There's a difference between healthy solitude and isolating yourself out of fear. You can't heal or grow in a vacuum foreverâat some point, you need to bring what you've learned back into the world. It's time to slowly, gently reconnect. Start small, but start. The people who care about you are wondering where you went."
    },
    {
      name: "Wheel of Fortune",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/vCd6FLN3/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "Things are shifting for you right now, and you can feel it even if you can't see it yet. That sense of anticipation, like something big is around the corner? Trust it. Life is cyclical, and if you've been in a tough period, relief is coming. If things have been going well, don't worry about when the other shoe will dropâjust enjoy this moment. You have more influence over your destiny than you think, but you also need to accept that some things are simply beyond your control. Work with the energy that's available to you instead of fighting against the natural flow of events.",
      meaning_reversed: "You're fighting the current instead of learning to swim with it, and it's exhausting you. Maybe you're trying to force something that isn't ready to happen, or you're resisting a change that's actually in your best interest. Life is trying to move you in a new direction, but you're digging in your heels. What are you so afraid of losing? Sometimes what feels like bad luck is actually the universe redirecting you toward something better. Stop trying to control every variable and start trusting that this shift is happening for a reason."
    },
    {
      name: "Justice",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/j0Kbmk6/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "The truth has a way of surfacing, doesn't it? You're in a phase where honesty and fairness are non-negotiable. Maybe you need to have a difficult conversation, make amends for something you did, or stand up for what's right even when it's uncomfortable. This card reminds you that integrity isn't just about big moral momentsâit's about the small daily choices to be honest with yourself and others. What decision would you make if you knew everyone would eventually find out about it? Make that decision.",
      meaning_reversed: "You're avoiding something that needs to be addressed, and the longer you wait, the more complicated it gets. Maybe you're being dishonest with yourself about your motivations, or you're afraid to face the consequences of something you've done. This card is asking you to get real about where you've been unfairâto others or to yourself. Justice delayed isn't justice denied; it's justice that becomes harder to achieve. What conversation have you been putting off? What wrong needs to be righted? Start there."
    },
    {
      name: "The Hanged Man",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/8LZF5FFM/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "You're in a waiting period, and it's driving you crazy because you're used to making things happen. But sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is nothing. This isn't about being passiveâit's about recognizing when it's time to pause, reflect, and let new perspectives emerge. You might be seeing your situation from a completely different angle soon, and that shift in perspective is exactly what you need. Instead of trying to force progress, ask yourself: what is this pause trying to teach me?",
      meaning_reversed: "You're stuck, and you know it, but you're not sure how to get unstuck. Maybe you're waiting for someone else to make a decision that affects you, or you're avoiding a sacrifice that you know you need to make. This resistance to letting go is keeping you suspended in limbo. What are you holding onto that's actually holding you back? Sometimes you have to release your grip on how you think things should go in order to discover how they actually need to go. The breakthrough you're waiting for requires you to surrender something."
    },
    {
      name: "Death",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/HsRWdM1/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "Something in your life is ending, and it needs to end. Maybe it's a relationship, a job, a way of thinking, or a version of yourself that you've outgrown. This isn't a punishmentâit's evolution. You can't become who you're meant to be while clinging to who you used to be. Yes, endings are uncomfortable and sometimes heartbreaking, but they're also how you make room for what's trying to be born in your life. What would you do if you weren't afraid of letting go? The death of one thing is always the birth of another.",
      meaning_reversed: "You're resisting a necessary ending, and it's like trying to hold back the tide. Maybe you're staying in a situation because it's familiar, even though you know it's not right for you anymore. Or perhaps you're afraid that if you let go of this, nothing better will come along. Your fear of change is actually preventing the very growth you say you want. What's really scary isn't the ending itselfâit's trusting that something better is possible. But staying in what's not working is a slow death of your spirit."
    },
    {
      name: "Temperance",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/dsbDky2h/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "You're learning the art of balance, and it's harder than it looks, isn't it? This card appears when you're trying to integrate different aspects of your life or different parts of yourself. Maybe you're learning to balance ambition with peace, or independence with connection. The key isn't finding perfect equilibriumâit's learning to adjust and readjust as life changes. You're being asked to practice patience with yourself and the process. Healing and growth happen gradually, not all at once. Trust that you're exactly where you need to be in your journey.",
      meaning_reversed: "You're going to extremes right now, swinging from one side to the other instead of finding your center. Maybe you're working too much and then crashing completely, or you're being overly generous and then resentful. This all-or-nothing approach is wearing you out. What would moderation look like in your situation? It's not about being boring or playing it safeâit's about finding a sustainable way to live that doesn't require you to constantly burn yourself out and then recover. Balance is a practice, not a destination."
    },
    {
      name: "The Devil",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/GvZsjYdv/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "You're more free than you think you are. Those chains you feel binding you? Look closerâthey're probably looser than they appear. Maybe you're trapped by your own limiting beliefs, unhealthy patterns, or fears that feel bigger than they actually are. This card isn't about judgment; it's about awareness. What story are you telling yourself about why you can't change your situation? What would happen if that story wasn't true? Sometimes we stay stuck not because we have to, but because the familiar discomfort feels safer than unknown freedom.",
      meaning_reversed: "You're starting to see your patterns clearly, and that awareness is the first step toward real freedom. Maybe you're recognizing how you've been giving your power away, or you're finally ready to break a habit that's been controlling you. This is the card of liberation through honest self-examination. Yes, it's uncomfortable to look at your shadows, but you can't heal what you won't acknowledge. The good news? Once you see your chains clearly, you can start to unlock them. What would your life look like if you weren't afraid?"
    },
    {
      name: "The Tower",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/kg03Nxh9/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "Something in your life is falling apart, and it feels catastrophic. But what if it's actually clearing the way for something better? The structures you built your life on weren't as solid as you thought, were they? This sudden change is shocking and maybe painful, but it's also honest. You can't build something real on a shaky foundation. Instead of trying to put everything back the way it was, ask yourself: what needs to stay broken? What was never really working anyway? Sometimes destruction is just renovation in disguise.",
      meaning_reversed: "You can see the cracks in your life, but you're desperately trying to hold everything together with sheer willpower. Maybe you're avoiding necessary changes because you're afraid of what people will think, or you're postponing an inevitable ending because you can't imagine what comes next. But you can't prevent every storm, and trying to do so is exhausting you. What would happen if you stopped trying to control the uncontrollable and started preparing for a new beginning instead? Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is let something fall apart."
    },
    {
      name: "The Star",
      image: "https://i.ibb.co/tPJwPXDn/image.png",
      meaning_upright: "After everything you've been through, you're finally feeling hopeful again. This card appears when you're rediscovering your faith in the future and in yourself. Maybe you're healing from a difficult period, or you're finally seeing the light at the end of a long tunnel. This renewed sense of possibility isn't naive optimismâit's hard-won wisdom. You've learned that you can survive more than you thought possible, and now you're ready to dream again. Trust those big, beautiful visions that are starting to take shape in your mind. They're not too good to be true.",
      meaning_reversed: "You've lost sight of your North Star, haven't you? Maybe you're feeling disconnected from your dreams, or you can't remember what you were working toward before life got so complicated. This card suggests that your sense of purpose is still there, but it's buried under discouragement or disappointment. You don't need to have it all figured out right nowâyou just need to take one small step toward what lights you up. What used to excite you? What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail? Start there, even if it's just a tiny beginning."

Maybe you're sensing deception, or maybe you're just seeing beyond surface appearances to deeper truths. This card reminds you to trust your gut even when you can't explain why something feels off. Pay attention to your dreams, your mood shifts, and those weird coincidences that keep happening. Your subconscious is trying to tell you something important. Don't dismiss what you can't proveâsometimes the most important truths live in the spaces between facts.",

Maybe you're seeing threats where there are none, or you're so caught up in worst-case scenarios that you're missing what's really happening. This card suggests that some of your anxiety comes from not having all the information, but that doesn't mean you should assume the worst. Instead of letting your mind spiral, focus on what you can verify and control. What's actually happening versus what you're afraid might happen? Ground yourself in reality."

You have a sense of wholeness and accomplishment that comes from staying committed to your growth even when it was hard.
